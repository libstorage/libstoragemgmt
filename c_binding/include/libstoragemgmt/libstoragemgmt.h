 *              * NetApp ONTAP volume
 *
 *      * Disk RAID pool -- LSM_POOL_MEMBER_TYPE_DISK
 *          Pool is a RAID group assembled by disks.

 *
 * Description:
 *      Query RAM cache settings for the specified volume.
 *
 * Capability:
 *      LSM_CAP_VOLUME_CACHE_INFO
 *
 * @conn:
 *      Valid connection.
 * @volume:
 *      Pointer of lsm_volume.
 * @flags:
 *      Reserved for future use, must be LSM_CLIENT_FLAG_RSVD.
 * @write_cache_policy:
 *      uint32_t. The write cache policy. Valid values are:
 *          * LSM_VOLUME_WRITE_CACHE_POLICY_WRITE_BACK
 *              The storage system will use write back mode if cache hardware
 *              found.
 *          * LSM_VOLUME_WRITE_CACHE_POLICY_AUTO
 *              The controller will use write back mode when battery/capacitor
 *              is in good health, otherwise, write through mode.
 *          * LSM_VOLUME_WRITE_CACHE_POLICY_WRITE_THROUGH
 *              The storage system will use write through mode.
 *          * LSM_VOLUME_WRITE_CACHE_POLICY_UNKNOWN
 *              Plugin failed to detect this setting.
 * @write_cache_status:
 *      uint32_t.  The status of write cache. Valid values are:
 *          * LSM_VOLUME_WRITE_CACHE_STATUS_WRITE_THROUGH
 *          * LSM_VOLUME_WRITE_CACHE_STATUS_WRITE_BACK
 *          * LSM_VOLUME_WRITE_CACHE_STATUS_UNKNOWN
 * @read_cache_policy:
 *      uint32_t. The policy for read cache. Valid values are:
 *          * LSM_VOLUME_READ_CACHE_POLICY_ENABLED
 *              Read cache is enabled, when reading I/O on previous unchanged
 *              written I/O or read I/O in cache will be returned to I/O
 *              initiator immediately without checking backing store(normally
 *              disk).
 *          * LSM_VOLUME_READ_CACHE_POLICY_DISABLED
 *              Read cache is disabled.
 *          * LSM_VOLUME_READ_CACHE_POLICY_UNKNOWN
 *              Plugin failed to detect the read cache policy.
 * @read_cache_status:
 *      uint32_t. The status of read cache. Valid values are:
 *          * LSM_VOLUME_READ_CACHE_STATUS_ENABLED
 *          * LSM_VOLUME_READ_CACHE_STATUS_DISABLED
 *          * LSM_VOLUME_READ_CACHE_STATUS_UNKNOWN
 * @physical_disk_cache:
 *     Whether physical disk's cache is enabled or not. Please be advised,
 *     HDD's physical disk ram cache might not be protected by storage system's
 *     battery or capacitor on sudden power loss, you could lose data if a power
 *     failure occurs during a write process. For SSD's physical disk cache,
 *     please check with the vendor of your hardware RAID card and SSD disk.
 *     Valid values are:
 *          * LSM_VOLUME_PHYSICAL_DISK_CACHE_ENABLED
 *              Physical disk cache enabled.
 *          * LSM_VOLUME_PHYSICAL_DISK_CACHE_DISABLED
 *              Physical disk cache disabled.
 *          * LSM_VOLUME_PHYSICAL_DISK_CACHE_USE_DISK_SETTING
 *              Physical disk cache is determined by the disk vendor via
 *              physical disks' SCSI caching mode page(0x08 page). It is
 *              strongly suggested to change this value to
 *              LSM_VOLUME_PHYSICAL_DISK_CACHE_ENABLED or
 *              LSM_VOLUME_PHYSICAL_DISK_CACHE_DISABLED
 *          * LSM_VOLUME_PHYSICAL_DISK_CACHE_UNKNOWN
 *              Plugin failed to detect the physical disk status.
 *
 * Return:
 *      Error code as enumerated by 'lsm_error_number'.
 *          * LSM_ERR_OK
 *              On success.
 *          * LSM_ERR_NOT_FOUND_VOLUME
 *              When volume not found.
 *          * LSM_ERR_INVALID_ARGUMENT
 *              When any argument is NULL or invalid flags.
